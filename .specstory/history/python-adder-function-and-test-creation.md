## Python Adder Function and Test Creation (5/17/2025, 6:38:26 PM)

_**User**_

create an adder python file, It should take two numbers, and return the sum of those two numbers.



This is a mac environment, so use python3

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can help you with that! I'll add a function to your `adder.py` file that takes two numbers and returns their sum.



---

_****_

```diff
-  
+ def add_numbers(num1, num2):
+   """This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum."""
+   return num1 + num2 
```

---

_****_

I've created the `add_numbers` function in `adder.py` as you requested. Let me know if you'd like to test it out or if there's anything else!

---

_**User**_

test it with pytest

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's test the `add_numbers` function using pytest.

First, I'll create a new file named `test_adder.py` in your workspace. This file will contain our pytest tests.

_****_

It seems like creating the `test_adder.py` file failed. I'll try that again.



---

_****_

```diff
-  
+ from adder import add_numbers
+ 
+ def test_add_numbers():
+     assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
+     assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0
+     assert add_numbers(-5, -5) == -10
+     assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0
+     assert add_numbers(1.5, 2.5) == 4.0 
```

---

_****_

Great, `test_adder.py` has been created with some test cases.

Now, I'll run pytest from the terminal to execute these tests. Since you mentioned this is a Mac environment, I'll use `python3 -m pytest`.

Excellent! All the tests passed. The `add_numbers` function in your `adder.py` file is working as expected.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

---

_**User**_

create a git repo and make an initial commit

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can help you create a Git repository and make an initial commit.

First, I'll initialize a new Git repository in your current workspace.
